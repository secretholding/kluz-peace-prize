How do you meaningfully improve the lives of people?</h4><p>Creating data on a map reconnects people to their home: an OSM contributor from the Sudanese diaspora said, \"As someone who left [Sudan] at a young age because of the war, I didn't get to see my home, so participating in this project helped me see where I came from. It gave me a sense of comfort\".</p><p>The data produced also is sometimes the only accessible pre-conflict reference to inform where people lived. When the pre-conflict record comes from crowdsourcing with affected communities, it is more representative, leading to more accurate damage assessments and context appropriate planning and coordination.</p>",

  "content_html": "<p>The Conflict & Displacement Program uses crowdsourcing with OpenStreetMap (OSM) and other open tools to locate infrastructure and create a baseline map pre-conflict, helping to better track structural impacts of war, and inform recovery needs. We navigate the challenges of collecting data in unstable contexts through flexible remote methods, conducting group “Mapathons” and other initiatives virtually or from safe locations with local open data champions and supportive global OSM experts.</p><h4>How does your project support peacebuilding and/or conflict resolution efforts in the context of a humanitarian crisis or developmental context?</h4><p>Crowdsourced infrastructure data underpins equitable rebuilding and long-term stability by providing representative pre-conflict baselines that help identify both what has been lost and what remains. Comprehensive building footprints ensure that all people affected by conflict are recognized, while mapping heritage sites, schools, and community centers helps preserve identity, reconnect displaced communities, and prioritize what matters most to those rebuilding their lives, strengthening social cohesion and laying the groundwork for sustainable recovery.</p><h4>In what ways does your project contribute to the existing PeaceTech ecosystem and research efforts in a compelling way?</h4><p>PeaceTech requires input from real people, and we are setting the precedent for people-based data with open tools, workflows, and a community of practice in conflict. OSM's neutrality and transparency make it an impactful resource for building trust and fostering collaboration with conflict affected communities.</p><p>The data is invaluable. OSM mapped 65%+ more buildings in some areas with better coverage than machine learning models. Community-driven information on basic services, key cultural sites, and home landscapes is more complete, leading to better informed stabilization activities to rebuild.</p><h4>With the award funds, how would you expand the scope and applicability of your project or research beyond its initial pilot?</h4><p>After our initial success crowdsourcing infrastructure baselines in Gaza, Lebanon, Myanmar, and Sudan, we aim to build on partnerships with local OSM champions and diaspora groups. Our next steps include funding local mappers and advancing replicable, innovative AI-enabled data methods to strengthen OSM and support recovery and resilience. Multilingual datasets and culture-focused sites remain a priority, and we plan to create iterative mapping processes with open-source intelligence to map heritage sites, community centers, and schools, vital anchors of identity in early recovery.</p><h4>How does your work leverage collaborations and partnerships to unlock new opportunities and maximize impact?</h4><p>The Program connects local actors with international networks, fostering collaboration around shared data needs with open tools. By linking priorities across groups such as OSM communities, DDMG, and humanitarian IMWGs, crowdsourcing impact is strengthened through solidarity.</p>"
