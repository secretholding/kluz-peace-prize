How do you meaningfully improve the lives of people?</h4><p>Our co-founders have spent decades building tools for peace - often in places where it felt impossible. One led de-escalation interventions in Afghanistan and the Middle East. Another created cryptographic systems for nuclear disarmament. Another built the worldâ€™s largest open-source database on WMDs. Now it all converges in one engine. Anadyr Horizon is an impact multiplier - scaling decades of peacebuilding into a single platform for crisis prevention.</p>",

  "content_html": "<p>Anadyr Horizon is a venture-backed predictive intelligence company that builds decision infrastructure for the age of strategic surprise. Our Agentic Systems Intelligence (ASI) engine runs millions of high-fidelity simulations to surface hidden escalation pathways, geopolitical anomalies, and decision-maker patterns. We serve national security, finance, and insurance leaders who can't afford to be surprised.</p><h4>How does your project support peacebuilding and/or conflict resolution efforts in the context of a humanitarian crisis or developmental context?</h4><p>Anadyr Horizon provides novel insights into crisis signal prediction. Our North Star platform simulates actors under stress and deception to anticipate the signals that drive high-risk outcomes in volatile situations. This capability stress-tests peace strategies, reduces civilian risk, anticipates institutional failure, and times interventions. When real-world signals emerge, our clients' responses are already pre-positioned and outcomes mitigated.</p><h4>In what ways does your project contribute to the existing PeaceTech ecosystem and research efforts in a compelling way?</h4><p>Our ASI technology is grounded in decades of research in physics, negotiation, and escalation modeling. Collectively, our founders have published 200+ scientific papers and 20+ books on topics from missile trajectories to terrorist decision-making.</p><p>With today's breakthroughs in AI and compute power, we've transformed that record into ASI - an operational platform delivering predictive decision infrastructure directly into boardrooms and situation rooms where it matters most.</p><h4>With the award funds, how would you expand the scope and applicability of your project or research beyond its initial pilot?</h4><p>We're a SaaS AI company serving government and financial markets. The Kluz Price reminds us to stay mission-driven - ensuring peace-focused modeling for fragile conflict zones expands alongside high-revenue theaters like Europe and East Asia.</p><h4>How does your work leverage collaborations and partnerships to unlock new opportunities and maximize impact?</h4><p>At Anadyr, collaboration is our core. We co-develop with scientists, universities, diplomats, and intelligence leaders. Our investors join our off-sites, working shoulder-to-shoulder with our technical team. We're a hub where people, disciplines, and missions meet to shape better decisions. Because collaboration is the greatest human superpower.</p>"
