# Execute project for development

## Prerequisites
- Create a Github personal access token as shown on: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Nuxt.js project set up
- Directus CMS instance

## Directus CMS
To edit or add new content for any of the following models, use the CMS:
- Winner
- Agenda
- Blogposts
- Highlights

All data is fetched through the contentImporter.js. The environment variable with the CMS endpoint is expected. The imported scripts is available in the directus folder.

!NOTE: credentials and any security key should not be exposed in the project code. Keep it safe and make use of env vars inside the project.

Usage

0 - Setup
```
npm install
```

1 - Run your fetch script periodically or as part of your development or build process:
```
node contentImporter.js
```
or make use the pre-configured package script:
```
npm run dev
```
or
```
npm run genereate
```
2 - Use Nuxt Content in your pages:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ description }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
const { title, description } = await queryContent('winners').findOne();
</script>
```

## Slides in Home Screen
Slides data comes from the Highlights content model in the CMS.
- The fields Brow, Title and Event_year should be filled with the event data.

- The Winner field is a relational with Winners content model.
Use the Adding Existing button to select one of those existing winners or use Create new button to add a new winner straight from the highlight form.

- Make sure to set status equal published to the highlight you want to show on the site. Othewise the most recent will be selected.

P.S Winner content model is described above on the Directus section.


## CCMDESIGN Components package library

## Authenticating
You'll need to export the created token into your session.
On the terminal, where you'll run the project, run the following command replacing `<token>` with the personal access token you just created:

```
export NPM_TOKEN="<token>"
```

You have to do this everytime you open a new terminal session.

# Execute project in production
- Add the token to the environment variables with the name `NPM_TOKEN` and run the build as usual.
